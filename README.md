# unifi-uxg-dnsmasq
Script to bring static DNS entires to unifi UXG. 

Basically, you could just add your static entries to `/run/dnsmasq.conf.d/host.dns`. Sadly, that's not persistent so we need to automatically create a softlink. Nothing too complicated so don't worry.

## 1. Scripts

The following script adds a softlink from `/run/dnsmasq.conf.d/host.dns` (which is not reboot persistent) to `/data/custom/host.dns`.
Some devices appear to use a different `DNSMASQ_HOSTFILE`. See [#1](https://github.com/StoneLabs/unifi-uxg-dnsmasq/issues/1) for more details.

### /data/custom/dnsinject.sh
```sh
#!/bin/bash


## Original credit for idea: https://ubiquiti-networks-forum.de/board/thread/8876-dns-alias-f%C3%BCr-uxg-lite/


DNSMASQ_CONF="/run/dnsmasq.conf.d/shared.conf"
DNSMASQ_HOSTFILE="/run/dnsmasq.conf.d/host.dns"
DNSMASQ_SOURCE="/data/custom/host.dns"


DATE=$(date +%F_%H:%M:%S)


while [ ! -e "${DNSMASQ_CONF}" ]
  do
    echo "$DATE -> DNSMASQ -> No Config, waiting 10s..." >> /data/custom/dnslog.txt
    sleep 10
  done


if [ -f $DNSMASQ_HOSTFILE ]; then
    #File Exist, do nothing
    exit 0
  else
    #File NOT exist, so symlink, restart
    ln -s $DNSMASQ_SOURCE $DNSMASQ_HOSTFILE
    echo "$DATE -> DNSMASQ -> Symlink to DNS Host file created!" >> /data/custom/dnslog.txt
    sleep 5

    ## Kill current dnsmasq, ubios-udapi-server automatically restarts it
    kill $(ps -ef | awk '/dnsmas[q]/ {print $2}')
    echo "$DATE -> DNSMASQ -> Service restarted!" >> /data/custom/dnslog.txt
fi

```


### /data/custom/restartdns.sh

This can be called by hand to reload dnsmasq if you edited the host.dns file. The above script will not restart the service if the symlink has already been created. While this script is not strictly necessary, it is very convinient.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

## Kill current dnsmasq, ubios-udapi-server automatically restarts it
kill $(ps -ef | awk '/dnsmas[q]/ {print $2}')
```

### /data/custom/host.dns

This is where you put your actual static entries. 
```cfg
host-record=example.url.net,10.10.1.2
host-record=example2.blablub.foobar,10.10.2.21
```


### Make them executable

```
~# chmod 777 /data/custom/dnsinject.sh
~# chmod 777 /data/custom/restartdns.sh
```

## 2. Cronjob to run the above script

This cronjob runs the script after a reboot and once every 5 minutes (just to be safe).

### /etc/cron.d/custom_dnsinject
```sh
## run the dnsmasq_fix script
## link to /etc/cron.d

MAILTO=""
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin


@reboot root /data/custom/dnsinject.sh
*/5 * * * * root /data/custom/dnsinject.sh
```

### Reload cron 

Don't forget to reload cron so the cronjob actually runs ^^

```~# service cron reload```

## 3. Done, enjoy :)

# How to add entries later on

Just edit `/data/custom/host.dns` and run `/data/custom/restartdns.sh` to "apply" the changes.
